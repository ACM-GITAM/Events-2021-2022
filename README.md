The activities that ACM GITAM, as a student chapter, engages in are limitless in terms of inventiveness and incorporation of information. Keeping the frontier always open for sharing questions, doubts, ideas, thoughts, and guidance, while getting all the required aid accessible under one section is also a driving factor for the conduction of event activities by ACM GITAM. The inference from the event conducted by ACM tends to help the curious, the enthusiastic, and the determined minds clear their doubts using a wide range of exclusive study materials and resources, exposing themselves to various skills with extreme proficiency. ACM GITAM provides unique networking opportunities, mentoring and bonding over shared interests through a plethora of events every year.
